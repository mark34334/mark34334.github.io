# Lab Environment

In this lab environment, you will have access to a target machine available at **http://target.ine.local**. Additionally, a Nessus dashboard is set up for vulnerability scanning and can be accessed via **https://localhost:8834/**. Use the provided credentials to log into the Nessus dashboard for further analysis.

**Credentials:**

```
Username: admin
Password: adminpasswd
```

**Objective:** Identify the services running on the machine, perform a detailed vulnerability scan, and capture all the flags hidden within the environment.

**Flags to Capture:**

- **Flag 1**: Explore hidden directories for version control artifacts that might reveal valuable information.
- **Flag 2**: The data storage has some loose security measures. Can you find the flag hidden within it?
- **Flag 3**: A PHP file that displays server information might be worth examining. What could be hidden in plain sight?
- **Flag 4**: Sensitive directories might hold critical information. Search through carefully for hidden gems.

# Tools

The best tools for this lab are:

- Nmap
- Nessus

### Note

In this lab, the flag will follow the format: FLAG1_MD5Hash. For example, FLAG1_0f4d0db3668dd58cabb9eb409657eaa8. You need to submit only the MD5 hash string, excluding the underscore (_). For instance: 0f4d0db3668dd58cabb9eb409657eaa8.

## Question 1:

Let's start with the first question with is `Explore hidden directories for version control artifacts that might reveal valuable information.` starting with nmap command.

```bash
nmap -A --min-rate=10000 target.ine.local | tee user_Nmap-A.txt
```
which revels quite a good number of areas where i can focus on which it found a .git repo on the web service running on the host on the port 80 and here is the nmap output.

```

Since the git is there let's take a look on that and found the flag1 setting right there!

## Question 2:

The data storage has some loose security measures. Can you find the flag hidden within it?

based on the question it says that its a data storage which means it's much be from database services and in here we found a SQL services running with the help of Nmap scans results. and now let's also the the target robots.txt hence it could have hold of any services that worth for us. and by doing so there is the disallowed directory called `phpmyadmin` and that is open without any creds to it, in plain so we navigate into it

By navigating through the php and found a database as `mysql` and also found a table called `secret_info` by looking into the table i got the flag_2!

## Question 3:

A PHP file that displays server information might be worth examining. What could be hidden in plain sight?

based on the question I found that i should be looking for the filetype as php on the target. so i have used the `fuff` tool which helps me to go through the directory and find the specific file i was looking for, here is the command i would works.

```bash
ffuf -u http://target.ine.local/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -e .php -c -mc 200
```

Description:
This `ffuf` command is performing a **directory and file brute-force attack** against the target web application at `http://target.ine.local/` to discover hidden files and directories.

 Breakdown:
- **`-u http://target.ine.local/FUZZ`** → The target URL where `FUZZ` acts as a placeholder for brute-force attempts.
- **`-w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt`** → Uses the `big.txt` wordlist from **SecLists** for fuzzing.
- **`-e .php`** → Appends `.php` as an extension to each word in the wordlist.
- **`-c`** → Enables **colored output** for better readability.
- **`-mc 200`** → Filters results to show only responses with **HTTP status 200 (OK)**.

the phpinfo is looks like  answer to from the question `A PHP file that displays server information` and so by checking out i found the flag3!

## Question 4:

Sensitive directories might hold critical information. Search through carefully for hidden gems.


Since this question all about navigating through the directory let's take a look at `robots.txt`
and take a look into the password directory and hooray I found the last flag sitting over there waiting to be discovered!

With that I finished the lab work for this modules. let's move to next chapter in this field of security.
